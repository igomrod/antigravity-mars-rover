# US-01: System Initialization and Positioning

## User Story
As a NASA Operator,
I want to initialize the Rover with a specific starting position and orientation,
So that I can begin the exploration mission from a known coordinate.

## Description
The system must allow the creation of a Rover instance with a valid coordinate (x, y) and a cardinal direction (N, S, E, W). This establishes the initial state of the rover on the grid.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Successful Initialization
Given a grid of size 10x10
When I initialize the rover at position (0, 0) facing 'N'
Then the rover should be at (0, 0)
And the rover should be facing 'North'

### Scenario 2: Initialization with different coordinates
Given a grid of size 10x10
When I initialize the rover at position (3, 5) facing 'E'
Then the rover should be at (3, 5)
And the rover should be facing 'East'
