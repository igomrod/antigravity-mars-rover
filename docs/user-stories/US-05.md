# US-05: Obstacle Detection

## User Story
As a NASA Operator,
I want the rover to detect obstacles and stop before hitting them,
So that I can protect the rover from damage.

## Description
Before executing any move command ('f' or 'b'), the rover must check if the target position contains an obstacle. If an obstacle is detected:
- The move is aborted
- The command sequence stops immediately
- The rover remains at the last safe position
- The system reports the obstacle encounter

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Obstacle Blocks Forward Movement
```gherkin
Given a grid of size 10x10
And an obstacle at position (0, 2)
And a rover at (0, 1) facing 'N'
When I execute command 'f'
Then the rover should be at (0, 1)
And the rover should be facing 'North'
And an obstacle should be reported
```

### Scenario 2: Command Sequence Stops at Obstacle
```gherkin
Given a grid of size 10x10
And an obstacle at position (0, 3)
And a rover at (0, 1) facing 'N'
When I execute commands "fff"
Then the rover should be at (0, 2)
And the rover should be facing 'North'
And an obstacle should be reported
```

### Scenario 3: No Obstacle - Normal Movement
```gherkin
Given a grid of size 10x10
And no obstacles
And a rover at (0, 0) facing 'N'
When I execute commands "ff"
Then the rover should be at (0, 2)
And the rover should be facing 'North'
And no obstacle should be reported
```
