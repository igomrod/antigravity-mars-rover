# US-02: Rover Movement

## User Story
As a NASA Operator,
I want to move the rover forward and backward,
So that I can explore different areas of Mars.

## Description
The rover must be able to move forward ('f') and backward ('b') based on its current orientation.
- North: y+1 (f), y-1 (b)
- South: y-1 (f), y+1 (b)
- East: x+1 (f), x-1 (b)
- West: x-1 (f), x+1 (b)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Move Forward North
```gherkin
Given a rover at (0, 0) facing 'N'
When I execute command 'f'
Then the rover should be at (0, 1)
And the rover should be facing 'North'
```

### Scenario 2: Move Backward East
```gherkin
Given a rover at (3, 3) facing 'E'
When I execute command 'b'
Then the rover should be at (2, 3)
And the rover should be facing 'East'
```

### Scenario 3: Multiple Movements
```gherkin
Given a rover at (0, 0) facing 'N'
When I execute commands "ff"
Then the rover should be at (0, 2)
And the rover should be facing 'North'
```
