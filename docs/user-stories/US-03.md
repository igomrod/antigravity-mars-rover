# US-03: Rover Turning

## User Story
As a NASA Operator,
I want to turn the rover left and right,
So that I can change the direction of exploration.

## Description
The rover must be able to turn left ('l') and right ('r') by 90 degrees without changing its position.
- Left: N -> W -> S -> E -> N
- Right: N -> E -> S -> W -> N

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Turn Left from North
```gherkin
Given a rover at (0, 0) facing 'N'
When I execute command 'l'
Then the rover should be at (0, 0)
And the rover should be facing 'West'
```

### Scenario 2: Turn Right from East
```gherkin
Given a rover at (0, 0) facing 'E'
When I execute command 'r'
Then the rover should be at (0, 0)
And the rover should be facing 'South'
```

### Scenario 3: Multiple Turns
```gherkin
Given a rover at (0, 0) facing 'N'
When I execute commands "rr"
Then the rover should be at (0, 0)
And the rover should be facing 'South'
```
